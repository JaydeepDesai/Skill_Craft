## ✅ Task 01: Population Distribution Visualization

### 📌 Objective:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable such as the distribution of **age groups** in India's population.

### 📁 Dataset:
Custom dataset showing age-based population distribution in India (2022).

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📈 Outcome:
Bar chart showing three main age group segments:
- 0–20 years: 512 Mn
- 21–64 years: 807 Mn
- 65+ years: 98 Mn

## ✅ Task 02: Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & EDA

### 📌 Objective:
Perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. Discover relationships between variables and identify survival trends.

### 📁 Dataset:
[Titanic Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan831/titanic)

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

### 📈 Outcome:
- Cleaned missing data
- Analyzed correlations between survival and features (e.g., gender, Pclass)
- Created visualizations for better insight

## ✅ Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier - Bank Marketing

### 📌 Objective:
Build a **decision tree classifier** to predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral features.

### 📁 Dataset:
[Bank Marketing Dataset – UCI ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib

### 📈 Outcome:
- Preprocessed categorical data
- Built and visualized Decision Tree
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ✅ Task 04: US Accident Data Analysis

### 📌 Objective:
Analyze **US traffic accident data** (2016–2023) to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather
- Time of day
- Hotspot visualization

### 📁 Dataset:
[US Accidents Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Folium (for heatmap)

### 📈 Outcome:
- Identified peak accident hours (rush hours)
- Weather condition impact visualization
- Generated interactive map showing accident hotspots
